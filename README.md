**Prospetto Pizzeria** is a fictional small pizza restaurant, and this project is for its conceptual website. The latter has a menu of pizzas and beverages that customer may add to cart. After shopping, the customer may review the cart, change quantity, remove, etc. The cart page has a checkout button but it is not implemented yet as it is a task for other team members. The Prospetto Pizzeria website does not send any server requests, everything is done client-side (JS, Web SQL) as it is a concept.
